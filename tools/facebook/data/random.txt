The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.
Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.
For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
He heals the brokenhearted and mends their every wound.
The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.
May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
The Lord is my light and my salvation—whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life—of whom shall I be afraid?
For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.
Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you; the Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.
Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.
Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!
The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he restores my soul.

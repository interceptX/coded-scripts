resolvectl dns enp9s0u1 8.8.8.8

replace enp9s0u1 with the actual name of your network interface.

Note that the resolv.conf file is managed by systemd-resolved, so editing it directly may not be effective. Instead, use the resolvectl command or the nmcli command to make changes to the DNS settings.
